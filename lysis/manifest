# CI builds.
#
# This package relies on additional libraries that aren't currently packaged and
# need to be installed through the system package manager.
#
# For now, only Fedora 41 is supported, as the required libraries must meet
# minimum version requirements, and Fedora is the only distribution that
# consistently provides the necessary up-to-date versions.
#
# ... Well, never mind. Despite my best efforts, CI just refuses to find
# libadwaita-devel.
